           <p class="position-demo">This is my MI 247 project, it is a 3D model of the midnight store scene! I spent a lot of energy and time in this work, and the final result is exactly what I want. I like to use colored lights to create a purple night environment.I tried to blend the buildings from the 80s with gorgeous lighting to show scenes that are not easy to see in reality.</p>
